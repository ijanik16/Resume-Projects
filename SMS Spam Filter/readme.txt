OVERVIEW
The SMS Spam Filter is a python application, run through Jupyter Notebook software. This software takes a dataset of SMS messages, processes and cleans the data into a more usable format, and graphs relevant data points and trends. It then uses a K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to create a machine learning model that will predict spam messages based on the tested and trained dataset. The program will then output statistics showing the accuracy of this created model.


HOW TO RUN
SMS Spam Filter should be run through the Jupyter Notebook application. Simply import this project and its dataset, and run it through the application in order to see all of the Graphical Data representations and the accuracy of the machine learning model that was created.
