OVERVIEW
The Android Destination Catalog is an Android Application written in Java that creates an interactable list of destinations in a Graphical User Interface that allows users to browse potential destinations, and simply tap the interface to be taken directly to the destination’s web page.


This program uses Android Fragments as opposed to the more traditional Activities, which allows the program to reuse user interfaces,  which greatly improves performance, especially on lower end hardware.


HOW TO RUN
The Android Destination Catalog can be run through the Android Studio Emulator. Simply open the files in the Android Studio workstation, and click Run on Emulator.
