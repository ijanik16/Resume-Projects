OVERVIEW
The Web Database application is a web based server that hosts a database where users can add, delete, sort, and create entries for a database, entirely through the web interface. This is all supported by a Java backend that facilitates the communication between the application and the server and sends SQL commands to the database. All of this is done through a simple to use Graphical Web Interface that allows users to easily make changes to their database.


HOW TO RUN


This Web Database application utilizes the Apache Tomcat Server v9.0 software in order to facilitate the server connections. When set up with a Java enterprise workstation, the program has been programmed to accept the following username and password:


USERNAME: madRID4598


PASSWORD: root


When completed, simply run the application with the tomcat server active, enter the username and password, and it should take you to the HTML web interface that has been created to interact with the program.
